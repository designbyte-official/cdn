# Avatar CDN Repository

This repository provides a collection of avatar images that you can use directly in your projects via CDN delivery. Images are organized into folders for easy access.

## How to Access Avatars via CDN

All images are accessible through jsDelivr CDN. Use the following URL structure:

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/designbyte-official/cdn/<avatar-folder>/<image-name>.jpg
```

**Examples:**

- Cartoon avatar:  
  `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/designbyte-official/cdn/cartoon-avatars/1.jpg`
- Human avatar:  
  `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/designbyte-official/cdn/human-avatars/3.jpg`

**URL Structure:**
- `cdn` — The repository root
- `<avatar-folder>` — Either `cartoon-avatars` or `human-avatars`
- `<image-name>.jpg` — The image file name (e.g., `3.jpg`)

You can browse the folders in this repository to find the image numbers you want to use.
